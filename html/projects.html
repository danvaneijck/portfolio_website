                <h6 class="project-title">Supply chain solutions built on the Blockchain</h6>
                <p class="project-description">At the end of my studies in 2019 I was approached by Professor Alan Brent from VUW to perform some research on energy consumption in supply chain solutions built on the blockchain.
                    This involved completing the first tertiary eduction course on blockchain and decentralized autonomous organisations run by Mark Pascall.</p>

                <p class="">Date: December 2019</p>
                <hr>

                <h5 class="heading">Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)</h5>
                <p>A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a network of agents interacting with each other according to an open source self-enforcing blockchain protocol. In traditional organizations, all agents involved
                    with the organization have some kind of employment contract that states their relationship with the organization and with each other. If an agent breaks the rules of their employment contract or
                    something else goes wrong, the legal contract will be enforced in a court of law according to the law of the country the organization resides in. However, in a DAO, there is no legal contracts
                    that determine the relationships between agents. Instead, agents are steered by incentives tied to the network tokens and fully transparent rules that are written into smart contracts. </p>

                <p>DAOs have many advantages over traditional organizations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coordinating resources when not all parties know/trust one another</li>
                    <li>Aligning large number of stakeholder contributions towards shared goals</li>
                    <li>Running organizations in a way that is resistant to censorship</li>
                    <li>Tracking and validating participation and contribution to a project</li>
                    <li>Accommodating a variety of levels of contribution</li>
                    <li>Allowing people and entities to contribute work in a jurisdiction-agnostic fashion</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So far, there is two generations of the development of blockchain technology. The first generation was the introduction of Bitcoin. Bitcoin created a decentralized eco-system for
                    holding and transferring currency. The second generation was the introduction of Ethereum. Ethereum also provides a decentralized currency system but with the additional ability
                    to add business logic to smart contracts. An example of such business logic would be: if company X completes task Y then automatically transfer Z amount of crypto currency to them.
                    For this reason, Ethereum is the most popular platform for DAOs to be built upon.</p>

                <h5 class="heading">Supply Chain DAOs</h5>

                <p>It is often desirable for companies in a supply chain to track physical assets digitally to be informed about location, trigger processes, certify ownership and perform the corresponding
                    payments. The reason blockchain technology is a good candidate to store supply chain data is that there are many different parties involved in the supply chain network. Although it
                    is often stated that certain organizations in the same supply chain are in &ldquo;trusted partnerships&rdquo;, at the end of the day they are still two different organization each
                    pursuing their own interests which means there is only a limited amount of trust [7]. Parties in a supply chain maintain contractual relationships. In the simplest case, the contract
                    involves one party buying x amount of y at a time t and a price p. When there is a high rate of exchange of goods it becomes hard to monitor, especially at a global scale.
                    In traditional systems, this information is stored and used in many different systems that are most likely in many different countries. This is one of the key problems that
                    using the blockchain can solve: the tracking and tracing of exchanged goods at a global scale. However, one challenge is having a trusted source of input data that translates
                    events in the real world into data on the blockchain. One method to doing this is by using an Oracle. Oracles translate events in the real world into transactions on the blockchain.</p>

                <p class="project-description">For my Engineering Honors Project in 2019 I performed an analysis of cryptocurreny price manipulations called "pump and dumps" and attempted to train artificial models to predict them.
                    I used python scripts in order to scrape data from the cypto-exchange Binance and created features to train machine learning models. Social media data was also collected and analysed in an attempt to predict manipulations using social media features.  </p>
                <p class="">Date: 2019 - 2020</p>
                <hr>
                <h5 class="heading">Research Abstract</h5>
                <p>This paper analyses crypto-currency market manipulation tactics known as pump and dump schemes. Historic market data is scanned for patterns which indicate pump events and we explore
                    how these pumps are organised through the social media platform Telegram. Logistic Regression and Random Forest models are trained to classify these events with an accuracy of up to
                    88.9% with a precision score of 0.92. Next, the artificial models are trained to predict these events up to one hour before they occur, using specially constructed features extracted
                    from candlestick and order book market data. Finally, we present initial work involving scraping social media for coin names and symbols, on the supercomputer Theta at the Argonne
                    National Laboratory in Chicago, Illinois. We also explore how additional training features could be constructed by using sentiment analysis on the extracted social media data.</p>

                <h5 class="heading">Problem</h5>
                <p>There is a big concern in the crypto community that some coin markets are turning "rotten", meaning that market prices are manipulated by groups of people in order to turn a quick profit.
                    Schemes called "pump and dumps" are often carried out on low valued alt-coins, in which the price of the coin is pumped up by manipulators and later dumped when they sell all of their
                    shares when the price is high. </p>
                <p>Pump and dump schemes are a type of investment fraud where an individual or group of people buy a large number of shares at a low price which results in the share value rising rapidly
                    (the pump). The group then convinces other people to buy all of these shares at the increased price, by spreading misleading positive information about the stock. Once all of the shares
                    have been sold, the share value returns to the original price (the dump) leaving shareholders with shares that are worth much less than they bought them for.
                    The people who organize pump and dump events have the potential to make a lot of money because they create an opportunity to sell a large number of shares at a
                    significantly higher price than they bought them for. The people who have been tricked into buying the stock at the inflated price lose their investment. Pump participants with left
                    over shares might be able to sell out when the coin is re-pumped at a later date, however this may never happen.
                </p>
                <p>Pump and dump events can be identified by looking at the historical price data of crypto coins. A common pattern is that the pump organizers will start to accumulate shares while the market
                    price is still fairly low. Once they start accumulating the shares, this drives the price up. As the price is rising, the pump organizers may start spreading false positive information about
                    the coin, creating some hype. This is where it is easy to suck in novice buyers, because they believe that the price will keep going up. Once the pump organizers are satisfied with the inflated
                    market price, they sell all of their accumulated shares at once, making a big profit. This sends the market price down and leaves all of the buyers that were tricked by the pump with shares that
                    are worth much less than they paid for them. Figure 1.1 shows an example of the typical shape of a pump and dump event. </p>
                <img  alt="pump" id="pump" src="../assets/pump.png"/>
                <p>In order to pump a coin, a large amount of buy orders must be completed in a very short amount of time. Therefore, groups which perform pumps must have a significant number of members in order
                    for the pump to be successful. Anonymous messaging platforms such as Telegram are used to plan and execute pump and dumps on alt coins. It is common to find pump and dump communities on telegram
                    where pumps are advertised. The admin will post messages in the channel promoting the time and day of the pump. The admin also posts the rules of the pump to make sure all of the participants know
                    what to do when the pump starts. Participants are told to buy big when the event starts and then to sell in small chunks in order to keep the price high. At the time of the pump, the admin posts a
                    text message or picture which indicates what coin is to be pumped. Everyone then rapidly begins to buy the coin to try and get in before the price skyrockets. </p>
                <p>The individuals who organize pump and dumps are the ones who profit the most [7]. This is because only the admin of the group knows what coin is going to be pumped. This means that during the days
                    leading up to the pump, they can slowly accumulate coins that they can sell at the inflated price. Channel admins also release the coin to pump to the premium channel members before the public
                    channel so that the premium members have a chance to buy in at a low price. When pump participants start rapidly buying coins, it is in fact the admin selling everyone their accumulated assets.
                    When the price peaks, everyone attempts to sell their coin, however they often struggle because there are no buyers. In the end, the admin and members in the premium channel make most of the profit.
                    The admin then reports how successful the pump was, by posting their percentage of profit in the public channel. This can be anywhere from 100% - 500% and makes future pumps look attractive to new
                    members of the community. This also encourages newcomers to pay for the premium channel, because the admin is promoting how much more profit can be made when the coin to be pumped is known early.</p>

                <h5 class="heading">Aim and Objectives </h5>
                <p>The project will attempt to identify a common pattern that pump and dump events look like by analyzing crypto price data with python scripts. Visualizations of the events in the form of graphs will
                    be developed and analyzed for patterns. Social media posts and comments on platforms such as Telegram will be downloaded and analyzed with text classification scripts, for indications of groups
                    attempting to promote certain crypto coins. The project will then attempt to match social media influence with pump and dump events in order to find a relationship between the timing of the social
                    media posts and the dumping event of the coin. </p>

                <h5 class="heading">Proposed Solution</h5>
                <p>This project will investigate the pattern of pump and dump schemes and attempt to build more predictive tools that can identify pump and dump events before the effected market is dumped.
                    Currently, the final deliverables include python scripts for:
                <ol>
                    <li>Downloading candlestick data and order book history from the Binance exchange and extracting pump and non-pumped datapoints using a peak detection algorithm</li>
                    <li>Scraping Telegram, Reddit and Twitter for coin mentions</li>
                    <li>Verifying datapoints by cross referencing Telegram data and pumped / non-pumped datapoints</li>
                    <li>Artificial models performing binary classification on pumped / non-pumped datapoints</li>
                    <li>Merging candlestick data and order book data for each datapoint</li>
                    <li>Extracting features from candlestick and order book data</li>
                    <li>Artificial models attempting to predict pump events with extracted features</li>
                </ol></p>

                <h5 class="heading">Evaluation method</h5>
                <p>The solution will be evaluated by training the artificial prediction models and observing the precision at which pumped datapoints can be classified. A precision score of less
                    than 0.8 or 80% will be considered as failure in terms of being able to accurately predict pump and dump events. This is due to the fact that the purpose of the solution is to
                    protect traders from losing money on risky coin investments. If the model cannot provide accurate predictions, then this may cause the trader to lose money.</p>

                <p class="">Date: 2018 - 2019</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="project-description">
                <h5 class="heading">Purpose</h5>
                <p>Spyre is a platform I helped to build in 2018 as part of a group project for a work experience course at Victoria University.</p>
                <p>The groups client was Andred Saker, a police officer from Lower Hutt, New Zealand. Andred approached us with an idea to build a tool that will provide at-risk youths with rewards for
                    adhering to an admin-built timetable (strategy) designed to encourage them to go to school as well as positive extracurricular activities.</p>

                <h5 class="heading">Scope</h5>
                <p> The software that was produced in this project consists of a mobile application for end users (youth) and a data representation web application for case managers and system administrators.</p>
                <p> The mobile application will aid the user in following an admin-built timetable (strategy), by tracking their location via GPS and comparing it with the expected location at a given
                    time of day. It will also require a fingerprint scan to prove that the registered end user is with the phone and indeed in the correct location at the beginning and end of events.
                    By adhering to the timetable and achieving goals, the end user will earn points which can then be spent in the Shop section of the application.</p>
                <p>The web application will store user data, convert collected data into a meaningful report for ease of reading by a human administrator, and provide the administrator with the capacity
                    to manage the end user's timetable, create new users, and deliver rewards that the end user has requested to purchase.</p>
                <p>The objective of the app is to encourage the end users to stick to a timetable administered by system administrators. This will benefit the user by guiding them into a daily routine
                    which they can eventually manage themselves. In order for this system to be appealing, they will earn in app currency to purchase real life products and experiences. The goal of the
                    web application will be to easily collect, store and display data in an intuitive way so that it can be easily interpreted. Any improvements in the end users attendance can then be
                    easily presented to potential sponsors.</p>

                <h5 class="heading">Where is the project today?</h5>
                <p>During the development of the project, we worked in partnership with the youth support service in Lower Hutt. Unfortunately, this partnership is no longer ongoing, which has
                made it harder for the client to get any funding support. The development of this project is therefore on hold until appropriate funding and sponsors are found. </p>
